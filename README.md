Aileron is a unique overhaul to Minecraft's Elytra, adding new enchantments and behaviours while rebalancing some of it's existing behavior to be better suited for multiplayer gameplay.

## Mechanics
### Camera Tilt
The player's camera tilts while rapidly turning at high velocities.

### Updraft Boosting
Campfire smoke boosts players upward when flying over it with an Elytra.

### Updraft Launching
Players may crouch on a campfire with an Elytra equipped for one second to launch vertically into the air when released.

### Campfire Stacking
Campfire smoke travels higher depending on how many other campfires are adjacent to the source campfire.

### Firework Contrails
Fireworks may no longer be used for speed boosts - they instead leaving a lingering trail, purely for cosmetic purposes.

## Enchantments
### Smokestack
Allows the player to store boosts while crouching on campfires, consuming them with the jump key while flying for a burst of speed. One maximum boost may be stored per level, capping at 3.
Incompatible with Cloudskipper.

### Cloudskipper
Horizontal drag is reduced depending on the player's altitude, allowing them to glide for much longer and at much higher speeds while above the cloud layer.
Incompatible with Smokestack.
